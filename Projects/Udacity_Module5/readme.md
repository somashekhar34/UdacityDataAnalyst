## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013 as a pilot program for the region, with 700 bikes and 70 stations across San Francisco and San Jose. Once expansion is complete, Ford GoBike will grow to 7,000 bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The attributes included in the dataset : Trip Duration (seconds) , Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude , End Station ID , End Station Name, End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual) , Member Year of Birth, Member Gender

 

## Summary of Findings

>     Different usage pattern/habit between the two type of riders are seen from the exploration. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated around 8-9am and 5-6pm on work days for subscribers, yet customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 17pm Monday to Friday.

>     The multivariate exploration of data strengthened some of the patterns discovered in the bivariate exploration and univariate exploration, the relationship between multiple variables plotted is visualized altogether and information are presented combined. The efficient/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours(8-9am and 5-6pm) Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more flexible and relaxing pattern of customer usage shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends for city tour or leisure purpose probably. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

>     October is the most popular month and July,june fall next. August and september aren't far behind.So,during the period of june-october the bike sharing has been good. 

>     As Number of subscribers who take ride constitute 85% whereas customers constitute 15%.So,Subscriber is the user_type with most usage 

>     The average trip rate is nearly 650 seconds. From the it's evident that the popular duration is in the range of 300seconds-1200seconds, which is likely to be more. 

>    Customer trip durations are longer (600-1800 seconds) than for subscribers (450-900 seconds).
    As the count of the subscribers are far more than the Customers.So,count isnt a great metric to find the relationship.Ratio is going to be good metric for comparison.
    So can probably think by the fact that subscribers are mainly commuters who take short trips to work/school rather than longer trips around the Bay Area

> The Average trip duration in every month has registered its highest values on the weekends i.e on the saturday and sunday!followed by the rest of the weekdays have having closer values to each other.The minimum average trip duration has been more than 600seconds i.e 5mins on everyday of every month!
